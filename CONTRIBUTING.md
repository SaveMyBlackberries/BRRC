# Contributing
If you wish to contribute to this project, such as fixing a bug, translation or anything of the sort, is highly suggested. You should however consider the following factors if making a feature:

1. How useful is the feature and how often will it even be used? If rarely used, it may add bloat to the WebUI.
2. Is the feature already implemented?

You should also do the following if you are writing a feature:
- Make sure to do through bug testing
- Make sure the translations are up to date
- Test on other machines with fresh dependencies
- Update the dependencies list
